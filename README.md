# 👋 Hi, I’m shashwat-srivastava

> “I’m not in a hurry. I build not just to ship, but to understand — each project a quiet mirror of how far I’m willing to go to learn.”

I'm a self-taught developer exploring the creative and technical sides of building for the web. Whether it's a smooth portfolio, a 2D game, or a clone built to reverse-engineer something I admire — I treat every project as a learning opportunity.
